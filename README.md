## Live-demo

Live demo **[here](http://php-login.net/demo2.html)**, live demo's phpinfo() **[here](http://phpinfo.php-login.net/)**

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3.7+
- MySQL 5 database (please use a modern version of MySQL (5.5, 5.6, 5.7) as very old versions have a exotic bug that
[makes PDO injections possible](http://stackoverflow.com/q/134099/1114320).
- activated mysqli (last letter is an "i") extension (activated by default on most server setups)

## Installation (quick setup)

Create a database *login* and the table *users* via the SQL statements in the `_install` folder.
Change mySQL database user and password in `config/db.php` (*DB_USER* and *DB_PASS*).

## Installation (detailed setup tutorials)

## Security notice

This script comes with a handy .htaccess in the views folder that denies direct access to the files within the folder
(so that people cannot render the views directly). However, these .htaccess files only work if you have set
`AllowOverride` to `All` in your apache vhost configs. There are lots of tutorials on the web on how to do this.
